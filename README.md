# dySky
**dySky** is a novel technique for processing Skyline queries in presence of data with partially and dynamically ordered attributes. Its main algorithm decomposes queries into a set of independent sub-queries, each of which operates on a subset of the data. 

This repository contains **dySky** sources together with its main competitors sources.
